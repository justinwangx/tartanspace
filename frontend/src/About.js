            tartanspace is a tool designed to connect students at Carnegie
            Mellon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each member of tartanspace completes a form containing pesonal
            questions that reveal information about themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Text responses from the form are then embedded into high-dimensional
            space using transformer-based language models.
          </p>
          <p>
            These embeddings are then mapped to 3-dimensional space using a
            dimensionality reduction algorithm.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with similar responses appear closer together in 3D space.
          </p>
          <p>
            tartanspace will be open until __, at which point the form will stop
            accepting responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then members will be emailed the names and contact information of
            their 3 closest neighbors in 3D space.
