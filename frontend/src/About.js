            tartanspace is a tool designed to connect students at Carnegie Mellon. Each member of tartanspace completes a form containing pesonal questions that reveal information about themselves.Text responses from the form are then embedded into high-dimensional space using transformer-based language models.These embeddings are then mapped to 3-dimensional space using a dimensionality reduction algorithm.
            People with similar responses appear closer together in 3D space. tartanspace will be open until __, at which point the form will stop
            accepting responses. Then members will be emailed the names and contact information of
            their 3 closest neighbors in 3D space.
